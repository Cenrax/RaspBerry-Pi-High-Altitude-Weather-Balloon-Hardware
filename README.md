# Raspberry Pi powered High Altitude Weather Balloon:

The hardware of the weather balloon or the payload section is structured as a 6 layered stack of Raspberry Pi hats.

![Stack](https://github.com/MonkHelios/RaspBerry-Pi-High-Altitude-Weather-Balloon-Hardware/blob/master/Payload/Pictures/InkedLRM_EXPORT_825743803905478_20190919_195242457_LI.jpg)

- The first layer is a Raspberry Pi which manages operation of all other stacks and undertakes necessary processing tasks.
- To power the entire stack we have a high current DC-DC converter as a power delivery unit which accepts 1S LiPo or LiIon batteries as input and outputs a steady 5V and allows a maximum current draw of 7A.
